### Gem installation

You can install ```stream_rails``` as you would any other gem:

```
gem install stream_rails
```

or in your Gemfile:

```
gem 'stream_rails'
```

### Setup

Login with Github on getstream.io and get your ```api_key``` and ```api_secret``` from your app configuration (Dashboard screen).

Then you can add the StreamRails configuration in ```config/initializers/stream_rails.rb```

```ruby
require 'stream_rails'

StreamRails.configure do |config|
  config.api_key      = "YOUR API KEY"
  config.api_secret   = "YOUR API SECRET"
  config.timeout      = 30                  # Optional, defaults to 3
  config.location     = 'us-east'           # Optional, defaults to 'us-east'
  config.api_hostname = 'stream-io-api.com' # Optional, defaults to 'stream-io-api.com' 
  # If you use custom feed names, e.g.: timeline_flat, timeline_aggregated,
  # use this, otherwise omit:
  config.news_feeds = { flat: "timeline_flat", aggregated: "timeline_aggregated" }
  # Point to the notifications feed group providing the name, omit if you don't
  # have a notifications feed
  config.notification_feed = "notification"
end
```

### Supported ORMs

#### ActiveRecord

The integration will look as follows:

```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end
end
```

#### Sequel

Please, use Sequel `~4`.

The integration will look as follows:

```ruby
class Pin < Sequel::Model
  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end
end
```

### Model configuration

Include StreamRails::Activity and add as_activity to the model you want to integrate with your feeds.

```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :item

  validates :item, presence: true
  validates :user, presence: true

  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end

end
```
Everytime a Pin is created it will be stored in the feed of the user that created it.  When a Pin instance is deleted, the feed will be removed as well.

#### Activity fields

ActiveRecord models are stored in your feeds as activities; Activities are objects that tell the story of a person performing an action on or with an object, in its simplest form, an activity consists of an actor, a verb, and an object. In order for this to happen your models need to implement this methods:

**#activity_object** the object of the activity (eg. an AR model instance)
**#activity_actor** the actor performing the activity (defaults to ```self.user```)
**#activity_verb** the string representation of the verb (defaults to model class name)

Here's a more complete example of the Pin class:

```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  belongs_to :item

  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_actor
    self.author
  end

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end

end
```

#### Activity extra data

Often you'll want to store more data than just the basic fields. You achieve this by implementing ```#activity_extra_data``` in your model.


```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  belongs_to :item

  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_extra_data
    {'is_retweet' => self.is_retweet}
  end

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end

end
```

#### Activity creation

If you want to control when to create an activity you should implement
the ```#activity_should_sync?``` method in your model.

```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  belongs_to :item

  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_should_sync?
    self.published
  end

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end

end
```

This will create an activity only when `self.published` is true.

### Feed manager

```stream_rails``` comes with a Feed Manager class that helps with all common feed operations. You can get an instance of the manager with ```StreamRails.feed_manager```.

```ruby
feed = StreamRails.feed_manager.get_user_feed(current_user.id)
```

#### Feeds bundled with feed_manager

To get you started the manager has 4 feeds pre-configured. You can add more feeds if your application requires it.
Feeds are divided into three categories.

##### User feed:
The user feed stores all activities for a user. Think of it as your personal Facebook page. You can easily get this feed from the manager.
```ruby
feed = StreamRails.feed_manager.get_user_feed(current_user.id)
```

##### News feeds:
News feeds store activities from the people you follow.
There is both a flat newsfeed (similar to twitter) and an aggregated newsfeed (like facebook).

```php
feed = StreamRails.feed_manager.get_news_feeds(current_user.id)[:flat]
aggregated_feed = StreamRails.feed_manager.get_news_feeds(current_user.id)[:aggregated]
```

##### Notification feed:
The notification feed can be used to build notification functionality.

![Notification feed](http://feedly.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/fb_notification_system.png)

Below we show an example of how you can read the notification feed.
```ruby
notification_feed = StreamRails.feed_manager.get_notification_feed(current_user.id)

```
By default the notification feed will be empty. You can specify which users to notify when your model gets created. In the case of a retweet you probably want to notify the user of the parent tweet.

```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  belongs_to :item

  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_notify
    if self.is_retweet
      [StreamRails.feed_manager.get_notification_feed(self.parent.user_id)]
    end
  end

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end

end
```

Another example would be following a user. You would commonly want to notify the user which is being followed.

```ruby
class Follow < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :target

  validates :target_id, presence: true
  validates :user, presence: true

  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  def activity_notify
    [StreamRails.feed_manager.get_notification_feed(self.target_id)]
  end

  def activity_object
    self.target
  end

end
```

#### Follow a feed

In order to populate newsfeeds, you need to notify the system about follow relationships.

The current user's flat and aggregated feeds will follow the `target_user`'s user feed, with the following code:

```
StreamRails.feed_manager.follow_user(user_id, target_id)
```

### Showing the newsfeed

#### Activity enrichment

When you read data from feeds, a pin activity will look like this:

```json
{"actor": "User:1", "verb": "like", "object": "Item:42"}
```

This is far from ready for usage in your template. We call the process of loading the references from the database
enrichment. An example is shown below:

```ruby
enricher = StreamRails::Enrich.new

feed = StreamRails.feed_manager.get_news_feeds(current_user.id)[:flat]
results = feed.get()['results']
activities = enricher.enrich_activities(results)
```

If you have additional metadata in your activity (by overriding `activity_extra_data` in the class where you add the
Stream Activity mixin), you can also enrich that field's data by doing the following:

Step One: override the `activity_extra_data` method from our mixin:
```ruby
class Pin < ActiveRecord::Base
  include StreamRails::Activity
  as_activity

  attr_accessor :extra_data

  def activity_object
    self.item
  end

  # override this method to add metadata to your activity
  def activity_extra_data
    @extra_data
  end
end
```

Now we'll create a 'pin' object which has a `location` metadata field. In this example, we will also have a
`location` table and model, and we set up our metadata in the `extra_data` field. It is important that the
symbol of the metadata as well as the value of the meta data match this pattern. The left half of the
`string:string` metadata value when split on `:` must also match the name of the model.

We must also tell the enricher to also fetch locations when looking through our activities

```ruby
boulder = Location.new
boulder.name = "Boulder, CO"
boulder.save!

# tell the enricher to also do a lookup on the `location` model
enricher.add_fields([:location])

pin = Pin.new
pin.user = @tom
pin.extra_data = {:location => "location:#{boulder.id}"}
```

When we retrieve the activity later, the enrichment process will include our `location` model as well, giving us
access to attributes and methods of the location model:
```ruby
place = activity[:location].name
# Boulder, CO
```

#### Templating

Now that you've enriched the activities you can render them in a view.
For convenience we include a basic view:

```
<div class="container">
    <div class="container-pins">
        <% for activity in @activities %>
            <%= render_activity activity %>
        <% end %>
    </div>
</div>
```

The ```render_activity``` view helper will render the activity by picking the partial ```activity/_pin``` for a pin activity, ```aggregated/_follow``` for an aggregated activity with verb follow.

The helper will automatically send ```activity``` to the local scope of the partial; additional parameters can be send as well as use different layouts, and prefix the name


e.g. renders the activity partial using the ```small_activity``` layout:

```
<%= render_activity activity, :layout => "small_activity" %>
```

e.g. prefixes the name of the template with "notification_":

```
<%= render_activity activity, :prefix => "notification_" %>
```

e.g. adds the extra_var to the partial scope:

```
<%= render_activity activity, :locals => {:extra_var => 42} %>
```

e.g. renders the activity partial using the `notifications` partial root, which will render the partial with the path `notifications/#{ACTIVITY_VERB}`

```
<%= render_activity activity, :partial_root => "notifications" %>
```

#### Pagination

For simple pagination you can use the [stream-ruby API](https://github.com/getstream/stream-ruby),
as follows in your controller:

```ruby
  StreamRails.feed_manager.get_news_feeds(current_user.id)[:flat] # Returns a Stream::Feed object
  results = feed.get(limit: 5, offset: 5)['results']
```

### Disable model tracking

You can disable model tracking (eg. when you run tests) via StreamRails.configure

```
require 'stream_rails'

StreamRails.enabled = false
```

### Running specs

From the project root directory:

```
./bin/run_tests.sh
```

### Full documentation and Low level APIs access

When needed you can also use the [low level Ruby API](https://github.com/getstream/stream-ruby) directly. Documentation is available at the [Stream website](https://getstream.io/docs/?language=ruby).
